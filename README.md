# BoilerplateApp

## BoilerplateApp README

This application has designed to create a basic configuration app to start any project from this app. It has a stack navigator, Icons, ThemeContext and some useful components and hooks.

### Getting started

You must configure your environment to handle react-native, you can check the documentation [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Before that you must run `npm install` to install all dependencies of the app.

And finally you can run `npm run android` or `npm run ios` to compile the app in your device or emulator and run `npm start` to start the app

You also must configure, for android, the value of GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in the file android/gradle.properties with a google maps api key you can generate one [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials)

You also must configure, for IOS, the value of GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in the file android/gradle.properties with a google maps api key you can generate one [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials). Notice if you want to use IOS maps this step is not necessary
